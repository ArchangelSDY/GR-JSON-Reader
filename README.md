Offline Reader for exported Google Reader JSON Files
====================================================

The new Google Reader really disappointed a lot of people, not only for its awful redesign on themes, but more critically, for its change on sharing. We used to take sharing as a convenient way to collect and organize those interesting or useful posts. But now, they are all gone. What we now have to face are the boring exported JSON files, which are hardly usable by common folk. Witnessing the complaints all over the social networks, I made this simple json reader specially designed for google reader, hoping it will be helpful for those people clueless about JSONs. This program was hacked together in just one night; I didn't pay much effort on making it more eye-appealling and I believe you won't be that demanding, right?
